Scramble2000.js â€“ Extract the essence of your sound by shredding it into pieces
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script will displace random parts of the current file, making the sound
shattered and unrecognizable. The idea of this script is to extract the actual
'essence' of the sound. It's a bit related to how granulizers work, but I 
wanted to have this functionality as a destructive function in my audio editor.

Note: You may want to perform Correct Errors on the resulting file to soften
up hard cuts a bit. I haven't found a good way to strip silence, otherwise I 
would have recommended doing that as well because for some reason, there's 
short, occasional micro bits of silence in the resulting audio.

COMPATIBILITY
-------------
Works in WaveLab Pro 10+. May or may not work in lower WaveLab versions.

VERSION HISTORY
---------------
0.1 - First functional version. Removed commented pseudo-code. There's some
corrections to be made, probably in the selection procedure, because somehow
the audiofile gets slightly longer every time you run the script against it.
0.1a - Initial version
